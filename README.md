## Development

The Knights Travail project was developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach, with a continuous integration pipeline via GitHub Actions, Jest, and ESLint.

The continuous integration pipeline was set up using GitHub Actions. Whenever code is pushed to the repository, the pipeline automatically runs all tests using Jest and checks the code quality using ESLint. This ensures that the code is always in a working state and meets the coding standards.

By using Jest for testing and ESLint for code quality, I am able to ensure that the code is working as expected and is well-structured, making it easier for others to contribute to the project. The use of GitHub Actions for continuous integration allowed me to automate the testing and code quality process, saving time and resources and ensuring that the code is always in a deployable state.
